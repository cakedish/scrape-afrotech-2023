Some consider it the predecessor to the cajun dish, jambalaya.\n\nThe experience of the Jollof Festival focuses on the pride West Africans exude in their native dishes, and a  condensed version of the experience will be present at Afrotech 2023!\n\nFestival participants not only get to enjoy these foods, but get to interact with the festival itself by voting to determine the winner of the “Jollof Wars,” a head-to-head battle that pits one representative from each country against each other for the title of Best Jollof Rice.\n\nSample Jollof Rice dishes in a festive blind-tasting, and vote for the best one at the Jollof Festival Afrotech!",
